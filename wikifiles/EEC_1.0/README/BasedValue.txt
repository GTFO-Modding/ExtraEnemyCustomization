What is ##BasedValue?

BasedValue is the unique input field for one the have original value or max value to use it.
BasedValue Support lots of input for single field.


Supported Input with Examples:


Unchanged Notifier String Format:
"Health": "Unchanged"
 - Set it to 'Unchanged', 'Ignore', 'Keep', 'Original' or 'KeepOriginal' will set this field to Original Value.
 - WARNING: Using this on field that doesn't have default value will make the value to their max value (If you set "RegenAmount" to "Unchanged" they will regen as full health immediately)


Percentage Format:
"Health": "100%"
"Health": "25%"
"Damage": "25%"
 - Set Value to Percentage format will gives you relative value from the base value (usually max value).
 - So in "Health" example, it will gives you value of percentage of MaxHealth.
 - While in "Damage" example, it usually based on Players MaxHealth value. So each shot damage can be converted into percentage health value which player can be found on their HUD.
 - Reminder: -25% is "value multiply by -0.25", not "value multiply by 0.75" always keep this in your mind.


Percentage Format(From default):
"Damage": "50% of default" //While Default value is 2.0
"Damage": "50%OF DEFAULT"
 - Set Value to Percentage format with "of default" suffix will gives you relative value from current Value (WARNING: only few fields have default value)
 - So in this case, Damage will be 50% of default value, which means it will be 1.0


Absolute Number Format:
"Health": "25"
"Health": 25.0
 - Using raw number will pretend them as Absolute Number. without any percentage Calculation.
 - This option is usually recommended for who used to using absolute value for damage, health or infection values


Complicated Format:
"Health": {
	"Value": 0.5,
	"Mode": "Rel"
}
"Health": {
	"Value": 12.5,
	"Mode": "Abs"
}
"Health": {
	"Value": 12.5,
	"Mode": "Unchanged"
}
 - One of the complicated way to write this value type
 - Value can be both from 0 to 1 percentage value in "Rel" Mode.
 - Also can be Absolute value if it's "Abs" Mode.
 - Or you could just set to Unchanged if you want.
